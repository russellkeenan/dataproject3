The columns in step5_tidy_data.txt are:

### subject
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. This is a number from 1 to 30 identifying the particular volunteer from the 30 volunteers.

Units information is not applicable.

### activity
A text string identifying the activity for which the measurements were made.

The activity is one of: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Units information is not applicable.

### mean of features (multiple columns)
Each of the reamining columns is the mean of a number of measurements of a feature. 

The raw feature data was sourced from the zip file. 
The raw feature data was normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
Units infomration is not available.

Further information concerning the methodology used to prepare the raw feature data is available in the features_info.txt within the zip file at the location above.

The columns are:
* tBodyAcc-mean()-X
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
* tBodyAcc-std()-X
